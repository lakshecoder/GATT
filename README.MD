# Genetic Algorithm-Based Timetable Maker

This project is a timetable generation system designed to create optimized schedules using a genetic algorithm approach. It features a user-friendly GUI built with **Java Swing** for easy interaction, while the backend logic is powered by **C++** to perform the complex computations required for generating timetables.

## Features
- **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive GUI, allowing users to input data such as available time slots, subjects, teachers, and constraints.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Utilizes crossover, mutation, and selection processes to optimize the timetable, ensuring that conflicts are minimized, and requirements are met.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any system that supports Java and C++.

## Technologies
- **Java Swing**: For the graphical user interface.
- **C++**: Backend processing and computation for timetable generation using the genetic algorithm.
  
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakshecoder/GATT.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Java and a C++ compiler installed.
3. Compile the Java and C++ files.

## Usage
- Launch the GUI via the Java application.
- Input the required parameters such as teachers, time slots, and subjects.
- Run the genetic algorithm to generate an optimized timetable.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve optimization speed and algorithm efficiency.
- Add more customization options for constraints.
- Provide multi-language support for the user interface.
